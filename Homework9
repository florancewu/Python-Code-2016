#Homework 9 Question 1
'''
This compares each element in the list to the very
first element to see if it is greater. If it is
greater, it replaces the value of what maximum is
'''
def max_abs_val(lst):
    maximum = lst[0]
    for i in lst:
        if ( abs(i) > maximum ):
            maximum = abs(i)
    return maximum

#Homework9 Question 2
'''
I used a count and looped through the list to find
the indexes. When an element matches the value, I add
the the number that the count is at to a new list.
'''
def find_all(lst, val):
    newlst=[]
    count=-1
    for i in lst:
        count+=1
        if i==val:
            newlst.append(count)           
    return newlst
#Homework 9 Question 3 Part A
'''
I kept popping out the last element in the list and appending it onto a new one
'''
def reverse1(lst):
    rev_lst=[]
    for i in range(0,len(lst)):
        rev_lst.append(lst.pop())
    return rev_lst
#Homework 9 Question 3 Part B
'''
I changed the order of the elements within the list by popping the last
element out and inserting into the beginning.
'''
def reverse2(lst):
    count=0
    for i in range(0,len(lst)):
        lst.insert(count, lst.pop())
        count+=1
    return lst

#Homework 9 Question 4 Part A
'''
This code loops through each letter of the string. It uses a count to find the indices and once the letter
changes, it resets the count and list.
'''
def encoder(string):
    lst=[]
    returned = []
    a=string[0]
    count = 0
    for i in string:
        if ( i == a ):
            count += 1
        else:
            lst.append(a)
            lst.append(count)
            returned.append(lst)
            count = 1
            a = i
            lst = []
    lst.append(a)
    lst.append(count)
    returned.append(lst)
    return returned
#Homework 9 Question 4 Part B
'''
It loops through the list and it takes the index 0 of each list and multiplies it
by index 1 and adds onto a string.
'''

def decoder(lst):
    string=''
    letter_lst=''
    for i in lst:
        letter_lst+=i[0]
        string+=letter_lst*int(i[1])
        letter_lst=''
    return string
